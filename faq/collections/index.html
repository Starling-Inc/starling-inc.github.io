<title>Starling FAQ — Collections</title>

<xmp theme="simplex" style="display:none;">
## Common Description
**Collections** — lists of tracks, which you could create, edit and delete.

Within collections you can manually change order of the elements. Beside that fact, you can perform multiple selection for further operations above the elements.
## Elements Availability
Starling allows you to add music from many sources simultaneously. Therefore, _not all the_ elements within the collection could be always available.

Elements from the [Storage](http://starling.audio/faq/sources/#storage) are available while underlying audio file still exists on the file system. 

You can move or rename original files on the file system, but once the file will be deleted, according element in the collection will become unavailable.
After that that element could only be removed from the collection.

Elements from the [iTunes Library](http://starling.audio/faq/sources/itunes) are available in case if they are still exists in it and downloaded to device within the **Music** app.
