<title>Starling FAQ — iTunes</title>

<xmp theme="simplex" style="display:none;">
## Common Description
**Storage** — a place within the app where you can find all files and folders added manually.

You can add any files, but Starling works with audio only, and, as sort of, with images (as covers for audio files).

Supported audio files’ extensions:
.flac .ape .wav .wv .ogg .opus .mpc .mp3 .mp4 .m4a

Supported covers’ extensions:

## Music Adding
There is many ways to add music to **Storage**: using **AirDrop**, **iTunes File Sharing** or from the other apps on your device.
### AirDrop
Starling supports receiving files from **AirDrop**, so just follow [instruction](https://support.apple.com/HT203106).

After files has been received, they will be moved to **Storage** into the [Inbox](http://starling.audio/faq/storage/#system) folder.
### iTunes File Sharing
If you does not have macOS computer, you can use [instruction for iTunes File Sharing](https://support.apple.com/HT201301).
### Other Apps
Some apps on your device can send files and folders to other apps on the same device.

Starling works with these apps: for example, you can send downloaded folder inside Google Drive app to Starling:

After files has been received, they will be moved to **Storage** into the [Inbox](http://starling.audio/faq/storage/#system) folder.
## Covers for Audio
Starling can display covers for your audio files even if they are actually separate image files.

If you’re used to store covers within the same folder that your audio files are stored in, and name covers like cover.jpg, folder.png or sort of, Starling will display that images as covers.
## System Directories
**Storage** has system directories. They are marked with appropriate icon and has many restrictions. Those are iOS-related restrictions.

System folders could not be **deleted**, inside that folders you could not **create** something, and moreover you’re not allowed to **move** or **copy** elements to it.

Despite this, all content which is in those folders **already**, could be moved or copied out of these folders.

One of these folders is **Inbox**.
## Subdirectories of System Directories
As said [above](http://starling.audio/faq/storage/#system), iOS has restrictions to system folders, and this applies to it’s subdirectories too.

If you have sent files or folders to Starling, they will appear in **Inbox**. You can listen to audio right inside it, but it’s better to move those files out of system folder in order to have more abilities over it.
