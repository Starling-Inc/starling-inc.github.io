##Common Description
**iTunes Library** — music, bought in iTunes Store. This **does not** include elements from Apple Music.
##Elements Availability
Apple pushes huge restrictions onto developers for which elements they could access.

Starling **displays** all the elements which you can see within the **Music** app.

Starling **plays** only elements which you have **bought** and **downloaded** to device.
